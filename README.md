## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these dependencies using `pip` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

# Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash

git clone https://github.com/Aadhirai2529/market-basket-insights.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash

cd market-basket-insights

# Usage

The main script for generating market basket insights is market_basket_insights.py. You can run it using the following command:

bash

python market_basket_insights.py
The script takes input data in the form of a CSV file named market_basket_data.csv. Make sure to place your data file in the same directory as the script.

# Input Data Format

The input data should be in CSV format with columns representing different products and rows representing transactions. Each cell should indicate whether a product was included in a particular transaction (e.g., 1 for presence, 0 for absence).

Example input CSV:


Transaction_ID,Product_A,Product_B,Product_C
1,1,0,1
2,1,1,0
3,0,1,1
4,1,0,1
5,0,1,1

# Output
     The script will generate various insights, including:

Frequency of individual products
Most frequently bought product pairs
Visualizations of the above insights
The output will be displayed in the console and saved as images in the output directory.
